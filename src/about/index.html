            Nice to meet you, stranger. My name is Guillermo and here we have a brief about me just to satisfy
            your curiosity.
        </p>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Well, long story short (as a good friend often says), I'm mathematician and computer scientist what yields
            a good starting point for data science. Technology and language fascinates me. Often I write poetry and
            develop unjustified code projects just to satisfy my own curiosity (like this web site, that is built with
            Polymer, but that is another story). With industrialization and digitalisation of our world craftsmanship has
            become a marginal way of do things. Although, the jobs of engineering and science are in many ways a
            combination of automation and craftsmanship, a conjunction that fascinates me and keeps me alive far from
            the frustration of repetitive work. That's why I keep doing such things.
        </p>
        <h2>Studies</h2>
        <p>
            I've studied Mathematics and Software Engineering at
            <a href="http://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/" target="_blank">University of Barcelona</a> both together and took me
            5 years and a half. My final project was about distributed computation of statistical algorithms (the
            actual title of the project is quite cryptic, so that's enough). That's all for the moment.
            But I'm targeting masters in semantic web, machine learning and distributed systems to continue my
            academic studies, because a long term project is to apply to a PhD in whatever interesting and
            useful for somebody.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also I'm a fanatic
            of continuous learning, so I've done some courses in Coursera. Just to name few:
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm" target="_blank">
                Probabilistic Graphical Models (Stanford University)
            </a>,
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gametheory" target="_blank">
                Game Theory (Stanford University & The University of British Columbia)
            </a>,
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/metadata" target="_blank">
                Metadata: Organizing and Discovering Information (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I'm interested in innovative technology and software, the list of software would be large and boring so
            I'm going to name just a few: Software Architecture, Java, Web Components, Web Animations, SVG, Distributed
            Systems, Reactive Programming, Python, Scala, open data, open standards and open software. Mathematically
            I'm interested in statistical models (like Probabilistic Graphical Models), predictive and prescriptive
            models.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also I'm love with poetry both reading and writing. My most favorite authors are (get ready): Charles Bukowski,
            Rudyarld Kipling, Edgar Alan Poe, William Blake, Ray Bradbury and Ernest Henley.
